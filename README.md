## Tech Stack
- **HTML** for structure

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

4. View the returned meanings and definitions.

## Learning Notes
Iâ€™m building this as part of my JavaScript learning path with ChatGPT.  
The goal is to practice:
- Fetching data from a public API.
- Working with nested arrays/objects in JSON.
- Rendering dynamic HTML with JavaScript.
